# FFTodile

FFTodile is a small FFT accelerator chip project built on top of the Croc
educational SoC. It combines a CVE2 RISC-V core, SRAM, OBI interconnect,
standard peripherals, and a custom user-domain FFT accelerator. The physical
implementation targets the open-source IHP SG13G2 130 nm PDK.

The repository contains RTL, bare-metal software, Verilator simulation, Yosys
synthesis, OpenROAD backend scripts, KLayout finishing, CI automation, and the
ArtistIC rendering flow used for mask-art and GitHub Pages previews.

## Project Overview

Current user-domain contents:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `rtl/user_domain/fft/fft_obi.sv` | Memory-mapped OBI wrapper, register bank, memory transfers, interrupt, and cycle counter |
| `rtl/user_domain/fft/fft_core.sv` | Compact iterative fixed-point radix-2 FFT datapath |
| `rtl/user_domain/user_rom.sv` | Read-only chip identification string |
| `sw/lib/inc/fft.h` | Bare-metal FFT accelerator API |
| `sw/lib/inc/fft_ref.h` | Fixed-point software reference model for tests and benchmarks |
| `sw/test/test_fft.c` | Deterministic FFT correctness test |
| `sw/test/test_sram.c` | SRAM address/data test |
| `sw/benchmark_fft.c` | Software-vs-hardware FFT benchmark |

The default build is a 16-point, forward, Q1.15-style fixed-point FFT with one
arithmetic right shift per butterfly stage. Other supported compile-time
variants are exercised in CI.

## Quick Start

Initialize submodules once:

```sh
make init
```

Start the intended tool environment:

```sh
scripts/start_linux.sh
```

Inside the container shell, run the local preflight before pushing changes:

```sh
make preflight
```

Useful day-to-day commands:

```sh
make help
make sw
make test-fft
make bench-fft
make test-sram
make sim BIN=sw/bin/test/print_config.hex
make synth
make flow
```

`make preflight` is the closest local equivalent to the GitHub preflight smoke
job. It runs script syntax checks, restores the default configuration, runs
helloworld and print-config simulation, validates SoC introspection output, and
checks the default FFT correctness/benchmark metrics.

## Architecture

FFTodile keeps the original Croc split between the main SoC and the user domain.

![Croc block diagram](doc/croc_arch.svg)

Main blocks:

- `croc_domain`: CVE2 core, SRAM banks, debug module, main OBI interconnect,
  SoC control, CLINT, UART, GPIO, timer, and optional iDMA.
- `user_domain`: user ROM, FFT accelerator, and an error subordinate for
  unmapped user-domain accesses.
- `fft_obi`: software-visible FFT register interface, source/destination memory
  transfers, status, interrupt enable, and cycle accounting.
- `fft_core`: iterative radix-2 FFT engine with local storage and a reused
  butterfly datapath.

The main interconnect protocol is OBI. Most generated physical outputs are
ignored by git and should be treated as build artifacts.

Current layout snapshots:

These images are refreshed by the `ArtistIC Render` GitHub Pages workflow. The
checked-in images under `doc/` are static reference snapshots.

## Memory Map

Default platform address ranges:

| Start | End | Region |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0000_0000` | `0x0004_0000` | Debug module |
| `0x0200_0000` | `0x0200_4000` | Boot ROM |
| `0x0204_0000` | `0x0208_0000` | CLINT |
| `0x0300_0000` | `0x0300_1000` | SoC control/info registers |
| `0x0300_2000` | `0x0300_3000` | UART |
| `0x0300_5000` | `0x0300_6000` | GPIO |
| `0x0300_A000` | `0x0300_B000` | OBI timer |
| `0x0300_B000` | `0x0300_C000` | Optional iDMA registers |
| `0x1000_0000` | `+SRAM_SIZE` | SRAM banks |
| `0x2000_0000` | `0x2000_1000` | User ROM |
| `0x2000_1000` | `...` | FFT accelerator |

The user ROM returns:

```text
FFTodile REV 1.0 - Flavian Kaufmann, Thanu Kanagalingam
```

## FFT Accelerator

Samples are packed into one 32-bit word:

```text
sample[31:16] = signed 16-bit real component
sample[15:0]  = signed 16-bit imaginary component
```

Top-level compile-time parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FftLength` | `16` | Number of complex samples per run |
| `FftDataWidth` | `16` | Signed bits per real/imaginary component |
| `FftScalingMode` | `1` | `0`: no butterfly scaling, `1`: scale each stage |
| `FftInverse` | `0` | `0`: forward FFT, `1`: inverse FFT |
| `FftUseRounding` | `0` | `0`: truncate scaled results, `1`: round-half-up before shift |
| `FftUseSaturation` | `0` | `0`: wrap on overflow, `1`: saturate to signed min/max |

Supported RTL lengths are 2, 4, 8, and 16 points. The default 16-point build and
a representative 8-point build are covered by simulation. The software
reference model currently supports the verified 8-point and 16-point cases.

Register map relative to `FFT_BASE_ADDR = 0x2000_1000`:

| Offset | Register | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | `CTRL` | Bit 0 starts one run |
| `0x04` | `STATUS` | Bit 0 busy, bit 1 sticky done; write 1 to bit 1 to clear |
| `0x08` | `SRC_ADDR` | Source buffer address |
| `0x0C` | `DST_ADDR` | Destination buffer address |
| `0x10` | `IRQ_CTRL` | Bit 0 enables completion interrupt while done is set |
| `0x14` | `CONFIG` | Synthesized FFT length, width, scaling mode, and build flags |
| `0x18` | `CYCLES` | Accelerator cycle count for the previous run |

`CONFIG` fields:

| Bits | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[7:0]` | `LENGTH` | Synthesized FFT length |
| `[11:8]` | `LOG2_LENGTH` | `log2(LENGTH)` |
| `[23:16]` | `DATA_WIDTH` | Signed component width |
| `[24]` | `INVERSE` | Inverse FFT build flag |
| `[26:25]` | `SCALE_MODE` | `0`: no scaling, `1`: scale each stage |
| `[27]` | `BIT_REVERSE` | Input is loaded in bit-reversed order |

## Software Interface

The public bare-metal API lives in `sw/lib/inc/fft.h`.

Minimal usage:

```c
#include "fft.h"

static fft_sample_t input[FFT_N];
static fft_sample_t output[FFT_N];

input[0] = fft_pack(0x1000, 0);
for (int i = 1; i < FFT_N; i++) {
    input[i] = 0;
}

fft_run(input, output);
```

The API exposes register access helpers, configuration decoding, busy/done
status, optional interrupt enable, cycle count reads, and blocking
out-of-place/in-place runs. Tests and benchmarks use `sw/lib/inc/fft_ref.h` as
the fixed-point reference model.

For non-default FFT simulations, keep hardware and software compile-time flags
aligned. Examples:

```sh
# Disable per-stage scaling.
make clean-sim
make test-fft VERILATOR_FLAGS=-GFftScalingMode=0

# Inverse FFT with rounding and saturation.
make clean-sim
make test-fft \
  VERILATOR_FLAGS='-GFftInverse=1 -GFftUseRounding=1 -GFftUseSaturation=1' \
  RISCV_EXTRA_CCFLAGS='-DFFT_REF_USE_INVERSE=1 -DFFT_REF_USE_ROUNDING=1 -DFFT_REF_USE_SATURATION=1'

# 8-point FFT build.
make clean-sim
make test-fft \
  VERILATOR_FLAGS='-GFftLength=8' \
  RISCV_EXTRA_CCFLAGS='-DFFT_SYNTH_LENGTH=8 -DFFT_SYNTH_LOG2_LENGTH=3'
```

## Build and Verification

Top-level Makefile variables:

| Variable | Default | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROJ_NAME` | `croc` | Backend/finishing project name |
| `TOP_DESIGN` | `croc_chip` | Physical-flow top design |
| `BIN` | `sw/bin/helloworld.hex` | Hex image used by `make sim` |
| `VERILATOR_FLAGS` | empty | Extra Verilator/top-parameter flags |

Main targets:

| Target | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `make init` | Initialize submodules |
| `make sw` | Build all software images |
| `make lint` | Check Python and C/C++ formatting |
| `make lint-fix` | Apply formatting fixes |
| `make preflight` | Run local CI-like smoke/regression checks |
| `make sim BIN=...` | Build software, build Verilator, and run one hex image |
| `make test-fft` | Run FFT correctness simulation |
| `make bench-fft` | Run FFT benchmark simulation |
| `make test-sram` | Run SRAM address/data simulation |
| `make flist` | Regenerate generated file lists |
| `make clean` | Remove generated software, simulation, and flow outputs |

The benchmark reports:

- software-visible cycle count for software FFT
- software-visible cycle count for hardware FFT
- accelerator-reported cycle count from `CYCLES`
- estimated host/transfer overhead
- out-of-place and in-place hardware runs
- `BENCH_CSV,...` lines consumed by CI

Print-config introspection is validated by `.github/scripts/check_print_config.py`.
It checks the SoC info word, SRAM sizing, generated peripheral base addresses,
optional iDMA presence, user ROM contents, and basic JTAG/core execution
sequence.

## ASIC Flow

The ASIC flow is wrapped by the top-level Makefile:

```text
Bender/file lists -> Yosys -> OpenROAD -> KLayout
```

Stage targets:

| Target | Stage |
| --- | --- |
| `make synth` | Yosys synthesis |
| `make floorplan` | OpenROAD floorplan |
| `make placement` | OpenROAD placement |
| `make cts` | OpenROAD clock-tree synthesis |
| `make routing` | OpenROAD routing |
| `make finishing` | OpenROAD finishing |
| `make backend` | All OpenROAD stages |
| `make gds` | KLayout DEF-to-GDS |
| `make seal` | Merge seal ring |
| `make fill` | Add fill |
| `make flow` | `synth backend gds seal` |

Clean targets:

| Target | Removed outputs |
| --- | --- |
| `make clean-sw` | `sw/bin`, `sw/build` |
| `make clean-sim` | Verilator build/log/waveform outputs |
| `make clean-flow` | Yosys, OpenROAD, and KLayout outputs |
| `make clean` | All of the above |

Generated logs, reports, waveforms, OpenROAD outputs, and GDS outputs are not
intended to be committed.

## ArtistIC Flow

The `artistic/` directory contains the rendering flow for GitHub Pages and
top-metal artwork previews. This flow is separate from functional RTL
verification.

Typical local sequence:

On the host, with Inkscape and ImageMagick available:

```sh
cd artistic
./run_artistic.sh --prepare-logo
```

Inside the OSEDA container:

```sh
cd /fosic/designs/croc/artistic
./run_artistic.sh --create-logo croc.sealed.gds.gz
./run_artistic.sh --render-raw
./run_artistic.sh --render-map-raw
```

Back on the host:

```sh
cd artistic
./run_artistic.sh --render-pdf
./run_artistic.sh --outline
./run_artistic.sh --render-map-db
cd mapify
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` to inspect the generated map viewer.

## Configuration

Main configuration sources:

| Source | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `rtl/croc_pkg.sv` | SoC configuration, core selection, SRAM sizing, main address map |
| `rtl/user_pkg.sv` | User-domain address map |
| `rtl/test/tb_croc_pkg.sv` | Verilator testbench clock/UART defaults |
| `rtl/croc_chip.sv` | Default FFT top-level parameters exposed to software |
| `scripts/generate_sw_config.py` | Generation of `sw/config.h` from RTL sources |

`sw/config.h` is generated. Do not edit it by hand. It is refreshed by normal
software builds such as `make sw`, `make test-fft`, and `make preflight`.

Current default SRAM configuration:

- `NumSramBanks = 2`
- `SramBankNumWords = 1024`

The technology-specific SRAM mapping is implemented through
`ihp13/tc_sram_impl.sv`.

The PDK is a git submodule under `ihp13/pdk` and is patched by `env.sh` during
tool setup. If git reports that submodule as dirty after the patch is applied,
use:

```sh
git config submodule.ihp13/pdk.ignore dirty
```

## GitHub Actions

All GitHub-owned JavaScript actions are pinned to Node 24-capable major
versions.

| Workflow | Triggers | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Preflight` | PRs, pushes to any branch, manual | Static checks first, then local preflight smoke simulation |
| `Short Flow` | PRs, pushes to `main`, manual | Simulation regression, FFT variant matrix with benchmark metrics, and synthesis metrics |
| `Full Flow` | Successful `Short Flow` on `main`, releases, manual | Yosys/OpenROAD/KLayout full backend flow through sealed GDS |
| `ArtistIC Render` | Successful Full Flow on `main`, pushes to `artistic/**`, manual | Logo/artistic rendering, map generation, GitHub Pages deployment |

The intended pipeline order is:

```text
Preflight -> Short Flow -> Full Flow -> ArtistIC Render
```

Preflight and Short Flow both run on pull requests. Full Flow is intentionally
kept out of the normal PR path because it is much heavier; it runs automatically
after Short Flow succeeds on `main`, or when triggered manually/release-driven.

Important CI scripts:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.github/scripts/run_preflight.sh` | Local/CI preflight smoke and default FFT regression |
| `.github/scripts/run_sim_flow.sh` | Default smoke simulation plus iDMA-enabled unit tests |
| `.github/scripts/run_fft_variant.sh` | One FFT build variant test+benchmark+metrics run |
| `.github/scripts/run_benchmark.sh` | Standalone FFT benchmark artifact generation |
| `.github/scripts/run_synth_flow.sh` | Synthesis run and metrics extraction |
| `.github/scripts/run_full_flow.sh` | Full physical flow |
| `.github/scripts/check_print_config.py` | Print-config log validator |
| `.github/scripts/check_metrics.py` | Variant and synthesis metric threshold checks |

CI regression thresholds live in `.github/metrics/baseline.json`. Update them
deliberately when a measured regression or improvement is expected. Generated
per-run metrics should remain CI artifacts, not committed files.

## Development Guidelines

For RTL source membership changes:

1. Update `Bender.yml`.
2. Run `make flist`.
3. Run at least `make test-fft`.
4. For synthesis-impacting changes, run `make synth`.

For SoC or address-map changes:

1. Edit the canonical RTL source.
2. Refresh generated software constants with `make sw`.
3. Run `make sim BIN=sw/bin/test/print_config.hex`.
4. Run `.github/scripts/check_sim.sh verilator/croc.log` if you did not run a
   wrapper flow that already calls it.
5. Update documentation if the change is user-visible.

For FFT operating-mode changes:

1. Keep Verilator top-parameter overrides and software reference-model macros
   aligned.
2. If a default FFT parameter changes, update the default in `rtl/croc_chip.sv`
   so generated software constants remain correct.
3. Add or update a representative entry in the `Short Flow` FFT variant matrix.
4. Run the default test plus the affected variant locally.

Recommended validation:

| Change type | Minimum local check |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting only | `make lint` |
| FFT datapath or software model | `make test-fft` |
| SoC/config/introspection | `make sim BIN=sw/bin/test/print_config.hex` |
| Synthesis-impacting RTL | `make synth` |
| PR-ready branch | `make preflight` |
