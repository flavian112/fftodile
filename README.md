# FFTodile

FFTodile is a small FFT accelerator chip project built on top of the Croc
educational SoC. The design uses a CVE2 RISC-V core, SRAM, a simple OBI
interconnect, common SoC peripherals, and a custom user-domain FFT accelerator.

The physical implementation targets the open-source IHP SG13G2 130 nm PDK. The
repository contains the RTL, bare-metal software, simulation setup, synthesis,
place-and-route, KLayout finishing scripts, and artistic mask-generation support
used for the project.

## Project Status

Current user-domain contents:

- `rtl/user_domain/fft/fft_obi.sv`: memory-mapped OBI register/DMA wrapper for the FFT accelerator
- `rtl/user_domain/fft/fft_core.sv`: compact iterative fixed-point FFT core
- `rtl/user_domain/user_rom.sv`: user ROM containing the chip ID string
- `sw/lib/inc/fft.h`: bare-metal software API for the FFT accelerator
- `sw/test/test_fft.c`: deterministic correctness tests
- `sw/benchmark_fft.c`: software-vs-hardware benchmark

The current FFT accelerator is a compile-time configured 16-point fixed-point
FFT. Samples are packed as:

```text
sample[31:16] = signed 16-bit real component
sample[15:0]  = signed 16-bit imaginary component
```

The default hardware build applies one arithmetic right shift per butterfly
stage, so the 16-point FFT output is scaled by `1/16` relative to an unscaled
DFT. The FFT scaling behavior is a compile-time RTL parameter; the selected mode
is reported through the `CONFIG` register.

The top-level RTL parameters for the accelerator are:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FftLength` | `16` | complex samples per run |
| `FftDataWidth` | `16` | signed bits per real/imaginary component |
| `FftScalingMode` | `1` | `0`: no butterfly scaling, `1`: scale each stage |

## Architecture

FFTodile keeps the original Croc split between the main SoC and the user domain.

![Croc block diagram](doc/croc_arch.svg)

Main blocks:

- `croc_domain`: CVE2 core, SRAM banks, debug module, main OBI interconnect, and basic peripherals
- `user_domain`: FFT accelerator, user ROM, and an error subordinate for unmapped accesses
- `fft_obi`: FFT control/status register bank, source/destination DMA, and completion interrupt
- `fft_core`: iterative radix-2 FFT datapath with local storage and one reused butterfly

The main interconnect protocol is OBI. The upstream OBI v1.6 specification is
available from OpenHW Group.

## Memory Map

The relevant default address ranges are:

| Start Address | End Address | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0000_0000` | `0x0004_0000` | Debug module |
| `0x0200_0000` | `0x0200_4000` | Boot ROM |
| `0x0204_0000` | `0x0208_0000` | CLINT |
| `0x0300_0000` | `0x0300_1000` | SoC control/info registers |
| `0x0300_2000` | `0x0300_3000` | UART |
| `0x0300_5000` | `0x0300_6000` | GPIO |

| `0x0300_B000` | `0x0300_C000` | Optional iDMA registers |
| `0x1000_0000` | `+SRAM_SIZE` | SRAM banks |
| `0x2000_0000` | `0x2000_1000` | User ROM |
| `0x2000_1000` | `...` | FFT accelerator registers |

FFT accelerator register map, relative to `FFT_BASE_ADDR = 0x2000_1000`:

| Offset | Register | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | `CTRL` | bit 0 starts one FFT run |
| `0x04` | `STATUS` | bit 0 busy, bit 1 sticky done; write 1 to done to clear |
| `0x08` | `SRC_ADDR` | source buffer address |
| `0x0C` | `DST_ADDR` | destination buffer address |
| `0x10` | `IRQ_CTRL` | bit 0 enables completion interrupt while done is set |
| `0x14` | `CONFIG` | synthesized FFT length, data width, scaling mode, and build flags |
| `0x18` | `CYCLES` | cycle count of the previous accelerator run |

`CONFIG` fields:

| Bits | Field | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[7:0]` | `LENGTH` | synthesized FFT length |
| `[11:8]` | `LOG2_LENGTH` | `log2(LENGTH)` |
| `[23:16]` | `DATA_WIDTH` | signed component width |
| `[24]` | `INVERSE` | inverse FFT build flag |
| `[26:25]` | `SCALE_MODE` | `0`: no butterfly scaling, `1`: scale each stage |
| `[27]` | `BIT_REVERSE` | input is loaded in bit-reversed order |

The user ROM returns the null-terminated chip ID string:

```text

```

## Tool Environment

The intended development flow uses the `hpretl/iic-osic-tools:2025.12`
container through the repository scripts. Start an interactive development shell
with:

```sh
scripts/start_linux.sh
```

Inside that shell, use the top-level Makefile. The Docker container provides the
RISC-V toolchain, Verilator, Yosys, OpenROAD, KLayout, Bender, and the other
tools needed by the flow.

The PDK is a git submodule under `ihp13/pdk` and is patched by `env.sh` during
tool setup. If Git keeps reporting that submodule as dirty after the patch is
applied, this local setting is useful:

```sh
git config submodule.ihp13/pdk.ignore dirty
```

## Common Commands

Initialize submodules:

```sh
make init
```

Build all bare-metal software images:

```sh
make sw
```

Run the FFT correctness simulation:

```sh
make test-fft
```

To test an alternate Verilator compile-time FFT configuration, clean the
simulator and pass a top-level parameter override. For example, no butterfly
scaling:

```sh
make clean-sim
make test-fft VERILATOR_FLAGS=-GFftScalingMode=0
```

Run the FFT benchmark simulation:

```sh
make bench-fft
```

Run a specific hex image in Verilator:

```sh
make sim BIN=sw/bin/test/test_fft.hex
```

Regenerate generated file lists:

```sh
make flist
```

Run synthesis:

```sh
make synth
```

Run the full OpenROAD backend after synthesis:

```sh
make backend
```

Generate and seal GDS:

```sh
make gds
make seal
```

Run the usual clean ASIC flow through sealed GDS:

```sh
make flow
```

Remove generated outputs:

```sh
make clean
```

Use `make help` for the full target list.

## Software Interface

The FFT software API is in `sw/lib/inc/fft.h`.

Typical use:

```c
#include "fft.h"

static fft_sample_t input[FFT_N];
static fft_sample_t output[FFT_N];

input[0] = fft_pack(0x1000, 0);
for (int i = 1; i < FFT_N; i++) {
    input[i] = 0;
}

fft_run(input, output);
```

For test and benchmark reference calculations, `sw/lib/inc/fft_ref.h` contains a
small fixed-point software model that mirrors the hardware arithmetic.

## ASIC Flow

The top-level flow wraps the lower-level scripts:

```mermaid
graph LR;
  Bender-->Yosys;
  Yosys-->OpenROAD;
  OpenROAD-->KLayout;
```

The main stages are:

1. Bender/file lists define the RTL compilation order.
2. Yosys parses and maps RTL to the IHP SG13G2 standard-cell library.
3. OpenROAD performs floorplan, placement, CTS, routing, and finishing.
4. KLayout streams DEF to GDS, merges the seal ring, and can add fill.

Current layout snapshots:

| Module Placement | Routed Design |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="doc/fftodile_modules.jpg" alt="FFTodile module placement" width="420"> | <img src="doc/fftodile_routed.jpg" alt="FFTodile routed design" width="420"> |

Useful stage targets:

```sh
make synth
make floorplan
make placement
make cts
make routing
make finishing
make backend
make gds
make seal
make fill
```

Generated outputs are intentionally not tracked. Use the clean targets when
rerunning a stage from scratch:

```sh
make clean-synth
make clean-backend
make clean-gds
make clean-flow
```

## Artistic Flow

The `artistic/` directory contains the rendering flow used for GitHub Pages and
for previewing the top-metal artwork/map views. The artwork is for visualization
and mask-art generation; it is separate from the functional RTL.

Typical local sequence, split by environment:

On the host, with Inkscape/ImageMagick available:

```sh
cd artistic
./run_artistic.sh --prepare-logo
```

In the OSIC/OSEDA container:

```sh
cd /fosic/designs/croc/artistic
./run_artistic.sh --create-logo croc.sealed.gds.gz
./run_artistic.sh --render-raw
./run_artistic.sh --render-map-raw
```

Back on the host:

```sh
cd artistic
./run_artistic.sh --render-pdf
./run_artistic.sh --outline
./run_artistic.sh --render-map-db
cd mapify
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` to inspect the generated map tiles.

## Configuration Notes

Main SoC configuration lives in `rtl/croc_pkg.sv`.

Important SRAM parameters:

- `NumSramBanks = 2`
- `SramBankNumWords = 1024`

The physical IHP SRAM mapping is implemented through `ihp13/tc_sram_impl.sv`.
The current `1024 x 32` logical SRAM bank maps to an IHP SRAM macro through that
technology wrapper.

User-domain address rules live in `rtl/user_pkg.sv`. The FFT accelerator is
currently mapped into the `UserDesign` region starting at `0x2000_1000`.

## Updating RTL Sources

When adding, removing, or moving RTL files:

1. Update `Bender.yml`.
2. Regenerate file lists with `make flist`, or update checked-in generated lists
   deliberately if you are avoiding Bender in a given environment.
3. Run at least `make test-fft`.
4. For synthesis-impacting changes, also run `make synth`.

## Upstream Context

This repository is based on Croc, an educational SoC developed as part of the
PULP project by ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna. Croc includes a small
CVE2-based SoC and scripts for IHP SG13G2-based chip implementation. FFTodile
keeps that infrastructure and replaces the generic user-design area with the FFT
accelerator project.
